        <h3>[insert blog title here]</h3>
        <p>
          I have so many things I want to say. Mostly, I want to say them to an
          attentive, receptive audience. (Don’t we all?) But I don’t exactly
          know how to find that right now, so I’m going to just put my thoughts
          out into the ether and see what happens. I long to speak kindness,
          empathy, and beauty with my writing. May God guide my hand to do this!
        </p>
        <p>
          I want this blog to be like me: a mix of many things. I’ll probably
          share some of my photos, I’ll talk about art and literature, and I
          probably can’t keep myself from talking about politics, but mainly I
          want to share about how mental illness affects my life and my faith. I
          have been diagnosed with many things over the years, but most recently
          with Bipolar Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My hope is
          that I will find strength in sharing my experiences, and let others
          know that they are not alone. I will strive always for authenticity,
          but sometimes I will fail. Please hold me accountable to this, but do
          it with gentleness! I’m learning along with you here, and trying
          things that scare me, and that I may not be awesome at. But maybe I’ll
          surprise us all!
        </p>

        <p>
          So, faith. I believe in the only, sovereign, ever-present God of the
          Bible. Yup, that God. He is complicated, but He is also beautiful and
          so, so, so BIG. Before you cringe and run away, please hear me out. It
          is possible to miss truth when it’s right in front of you because of
          the filter that you take all information in through. I know this from
          experience. For all my life, I’ve filtered Scripture and almost
          everything anyone has ever said to me through the belief that “I am
          not enough.” When you start with that assumption, even the best
          well-intentioned advice or encouragement to grow becomes an exposure
          of your inadequacy. God can then not love me while simultaneously
          grieving my sin because all He can see (from my perspective) is the
          way my failures prove that I’m not enough to be worthy of His, or
          anyone’s, love.
        </p>
        <p>
          See how that skews everything? Hang with me, there is good news at the
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          But first, I want to acknowledge how the Church (all Christians around
          the world) and especially the American church, has missed the point
          many times. We have truly made God in our own image, and not let Him
          be His glorious Self. We have made Him into the ultimate self-help
          guru, who came to make us more powerful, healthy, wealthy, and wise.
          Because we have married Biblical truth with an obsession with
          progress, many people have been left in the dust (the differently
          abled, the chronically ill, those with nontraditional sexuality, and
          people of color, just to name a few). And those not left in the dust
          often feel compelled to hide behind a mask of smiles, lest they be
          exposed as the one person who isn’t getting better. God becomes a
          cosmic scorekeeper, a judgmental parent with hands on hips, tapping
          His foot in frustration with our slow progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have denied our corporate sins as a church, because we can’t admit
          that we’re not making progress all the time. So I have witnessed God
          people deny racism, sexism, and discrimination against the differently
          abled and mentally ill. It breaks my heart, and I do not condone or
          excuse it. God offers free forgiveness (purchased at great cost by
          Jesus; see below), if we’d just admit how horribly we have messed up
          and that we can’t undo the damage we’ve done without Divine
          intervention!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you really look at the life of Jesus, it is hard to claim that He
          made any progress in His life. He went from being a simple carpenter
          to being an itinerant preacher to losing almost all his followers and
          dying in pain and humiliation. Where’s the progress in that??
        </p>
        <p>
          But in His life I’ve found incredibly beautiful truth. He knows pain.
          He knows failure. He knows poverty. That means He knows what I’ve been
          through. He gets it. He didn’t consider Himself above it. He was
          willing to go through all of that to show all of us how much He wants
          to be with us. Always. No matter how hard, no matter how messy our
          lives are. Even when we are making no progress. We might even be
          getting worse. When Jesus hung on that cross, rejected, humiliated and
          abandoned, what could have been worse than that? And yet He did it; He
          demonstrated how evil and destructive sin really is, and in doing so
          validated how excruciating it is when others hurt us. He gets that. He
          suffered, because someone had to take responsibility for all the evil
          in the world. To acknowledge how horrific it really was, and to show
          what He was willing to go through to give us His eternal,
          unconditional acceptance. Think about that! Unconditional acceptance?!
          Who does that???
        </p>
        <p>Jesus doesn’t just love you, He LIKES you!</p>
        <p>
          And this is what has saved my life. It has helped me believe that I
          actually am enough; and that I’m not failing at life or at being
          human. And that experiencing the world differently from most other
          people is not a bad thing, and actually reflects the creativity and
          complexity of God.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will try to flesh this out more as I go. Right now, I just had to
          get something down. I have to start somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to walking this path with you. Let’s see where it takes
          us.
